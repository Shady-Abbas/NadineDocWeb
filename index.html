        <p>Nadine Sayed, a 21 year old Egyptian born in Germany, is a fierce character to stumble upon. She has the most mesmerizing eyes, the kind that capture the light like a thousand stars, drawing you in with their deep enchanting gaze. Her stunning black hair, her gorgeous face, her unique style, her calming voice, everything about her radiates an effortless charm that captivates everyone around her. By everyone, I mean me; I am everyone.</p>
        <p>Despite what she tells you when you first meet her, Nadine is 5'1" and can't reach the top shelf if she tried. Fortunately, that is one of the most appealing things about her. But DO NOT be fooled, she is Satan's first child.</p>

        <header>Personalities</header>
        <p>Nadine's personalities vary on a day-to-day basis, here they are:</p>
          <p><div class="bold">Bitch Personality: </div>Acts sassy and passive-aggressive with anyone in sight. Any inconvience pisses her off. She claims it is her "period" that is making her act like that, but in reality, she's just a bitch. To this day, no one can figure out the case for this behavior, it is unpredictable and therefore the most terrifying personality.</p>
          <p><div class="bold">Jealous Personality: </div>As her future husband, I can vouch that Nadine acts jealous and possessive after a mention of a girl, or if a girl glimpses in my direction. This is a very attractive and interesting trait.</p>
          <p><div class="bold">Affectionate Personality: </div>After a long or hard day, Nadine seeks comfort in the arms of her future husband, which he gladly accepts. </p>
          <p><div class="bold">Talkative Personality: </div> Sometimes, the subject gets a random burst of energy where she talks a lot about a certain subject. Her face lights up and she uses a lot of body language, which her future fiance loves. Seeing the subject experience human emotions and traits reminds the fiance that she might not be fully a short devil from the depths of Hell.</p>
          <p><div class="bold">Annoying Personality: </div>This. This right here would drive you crazy. SHE IS FUCKING ANNOYING. She would, and trust me on this, push every nerve in your body. The reason? She loves you. That's how the specimen conveys her love sometimes. Remember that the next time you feel the need to kill her, God knows I do.</p>
          <p><div class="bold">Talking Mad Shit Personality: </div>MAN I LOVE THIS TRAIT. When someone gets on the midget's nerves, it is crucial to grab the nearest snack and sit your ass down to listen to the most out-of-pocket violating insults. </p>
